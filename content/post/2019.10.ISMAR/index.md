On Oct. 14-18 of 2019, I attended IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) as a student volunteer at Beijing, China.
During the conference, I had the honor of interpreting an interview with [Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-schmalstieg/) for the BAST Channel.
As my previous institute was one of the organizers, I managed to reunite with my previous colleagues.
