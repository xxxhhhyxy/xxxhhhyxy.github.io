[PerSiVal](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/exc/research/pn/pn7/pn7-1/) is a team working on enabling the visualisation of complex biomechanical simulations, specifically of a human arm, directly on the body of a person to be observed in a virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR) setup. It is funded by [EXC SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) and consists of Ph.D. students from Biomechanical Simulation, Distributed System and Visualization. In the October of 2021, we presented our joint poster "Visualization based on Distributed Neural Networks for Pervasive Continuum-Mechanical Simulation in Biomechanics" on the Status Seminar of SimTech, and eventually won the [best poster award](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/communication/Best-Poster-Award-goes-to-Project-PerSiVal-00001/), voted by all participants of the seminar,
