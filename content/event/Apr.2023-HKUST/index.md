summary: Invited by Dr. Yuyang Wang at Computational Media and Arts (CMA), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)
abstract: 'Virtual and augmented reality technology grants new possibilities to the movement tutorial. On the one hand, VR/ AR visualizes the movement instructions in the 3D world, avoiding misperceptions caused by the missing angle and depth information when using traditional 2D screens. With the tracking device in the VR/ AR system, on the other hand, the users receive precise real-time feedback and even correction guidance during training to improve their performance. So far, we have run a series of user studies to propose the design implications for MR-based motion guidance in terms of user perspective, visual encoding, and motion features. And I would like to continue my research on 1) memorability of motion guidance and 2) realistic user scenarios like physiotherapy.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
