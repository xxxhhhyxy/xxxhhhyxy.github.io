summary: Invited by Prof. Dr. Siming Chen at Fudan Visualization Research Group (FDU-VIS), Fudan University.
abstract: 'Virtual and augmented reality technology grants new possibilities to the movement tutorial. On the one hand, VR/ AR visualizes the movement instructions in the 3D world, avoiding misperceptions caused by the missing angle and depth information when using traditional 2D screens. With the tracking device in the VR/ AR system, on the other hand, the users receive precise real-time feedback and even correction guidance during training to improve their performance. So far, we have run a series of user studies to propose the design implications for MR-based motion guidance in terms of user perspective, visual encoding, and motion features. And I would like to continue my research on 1) memorability of motion guidance and 2) realistic user scenarios like physiotherapy.'
